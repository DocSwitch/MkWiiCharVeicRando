# Mario Kart Wii Character and Veichle Randomizer
A tool to randomly generate character and veichle combinations for Mario Kart Wii.

# What is it?
This is a program to randomly extract any character and veichle combination for Mario Kart Wii.

# How do I use it? 
Once you have a built executable (see below), just run the file. Instructions will appear on-screen.

# How do I build it?
First of all, you'll need to have the .NET 7.0 SDK installed. Then, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/DocSwitch/MkWiiCharVeicRando
    cd MkWiiCharVeicRando
    
Then, build with `dotnet build`.

Your compiled binaries will be in `bin\bin\Debug\net7.0`.

# Notes

For now, this is in Italian only. I will translate it sooner or later, or maybe add support for multiple languages.
